# Learning-AngularJS-1.3
Back in 2014, I revamped the mobile version of a website with AngularJS 1.3, I learned it from zero and designed the app by myself. However, after not getting involved for over 3 years, I found myself being a beginner again. So recently I started warming up, and this project is aimed to keep track on my study progress, and in addition, it is also meant to be a tutorial for other beginners. As this example's functionalities get augmented, each branch will come with new feature that demonstrates the usage of a certin facility of AngularJS, and each branch will be a superset of features of previous ones.
For simplity, I removed all dependencies of other JS libraries like jQuery, and CSS frameworks like bootstrap, so I can isolate and focus on AngularJS. The first branch is an empty AngularJS app doing nothing, it has only one module, and nothing defined under it. The sole directive it uses is ng-include. This will be the starting point of the tutorial.
